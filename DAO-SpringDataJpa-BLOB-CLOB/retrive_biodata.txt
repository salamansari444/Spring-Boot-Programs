Indigenous tribals have inhabited Mumbai (Bombay) 
since the Stone Age.[citation needed] The Kolis and 
Aagri (a Marathi-Konkani people)[1] were the 
earliest known settlers of the islands. 


The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during 
the 3rd century BCE and transformed them into a 
centre of Hindu-Buddhist culture and religion.


[citation needed] Later, between the 2nd century BCE 
and 10th century CE, the islands came under the control 
of successive indigenous dynasties: 
the Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, 
Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas, 
Rashtrakutas, Silharas& Cholas
